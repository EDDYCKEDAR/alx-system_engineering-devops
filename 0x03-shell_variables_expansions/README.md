# 0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions

This project covers advanced concepts in shell scripting, focusing on:

- Shell initialization files
- Shell variables and expansions
- Creating and using aliases
- Variable assignment and scope
- Arithmetic and string operations in shell
- The `export`, `unset`, and `readonly` commands

## Tasks Overview

### 0. <o>
- **Script:** `0-alias`
- **Description:** Creates an alias `ls` that runs the command `rm *`.  
  ⚠️ Use with caution as this deletes all files in the current directory when `ls` is run.

More tasks in this project demonstrate how to:
- Use shell arithmetic
- Define local and global variables
- Handle command substitution and expansion
- Safely manipulate variables for different shell behaviors
