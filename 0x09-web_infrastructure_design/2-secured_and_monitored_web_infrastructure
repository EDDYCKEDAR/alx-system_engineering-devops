Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure
Design

Infrastructure Overview
• Three servers, each protected by firewalls.
• SSL certificate for HTTPS traffic to secure communication.
• Monitoring clients (e.g., Sumologic agents) on servers collecting logs and metrics.

Why add these?
• Firewalls: Control network traffic, protect servers from unauthorized access.
• HTTPS (SSL/TLS): Encrypt data in transit, protecting user privacy and data integrity.
• Monitoring tools: Collect data (logs, metrics) to analyze performance and detect
issues.

Monitoring Details
• Monitoring clients collect data and send it to centralized monitoring services.
• To monitor QPS (queries per second) on web servers, configure web server access
logs or metrics exporters (e.g., Prometheus exporters).

Issues with this setup
• SSL termination at load balancer can expose unencrypted traffic internally.
• Only one MySQL server accepts writes; no failover on write operations.
• Servers running all components (DB, app, web) complicate scaling and security.

Summary

Setup 
1. Simple Web Stack
2.Distributed Infrastructure
3.Secured & Monitored Setup
Pros
1. Easy to setup and manage
2.Better load distribution, separation
3.Secure, encrypted, monitored
Cons
1.SPOF, no scalability, downtime
2.SPOF, no scalability, downtime
3.Complexity, SSL termination issue, single write DB
